# Bank-Marketing-Classification-System-ML-ASSIGNMENT-

# Problem Statement
This project implements multiple machine learning models to predict the success of bank marketing campaigns. Users can upload test data in CSV format and choose among several classifiers to evaluate performance.

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. This helps improve marketing efficiency, reduce unnecessary customer contact, and increase campaign success rates through data-driven decision-making.

# Dataset Description
Bank Marketing Dataset

This project uses the Bank Marketing Dataset, which contains data related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The objective is to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic, financial, and campaign-related attributes.

# Target Variable

deposit
yes – Customer subscribed to a term deposit
no – Customer did not subscribe
This is a binary classification problem.

# Dataset Overview

Type: Structured tabular dataset
Task: Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
Number of Features: 16 input features + 1 target variable
Target Type: Binary (Yes/No)

# Feature Description

1. Age – Age of the client
2. Job – Type of job
3. Marital – Marital status
4. Education – Education level
5. Default – Has credit in default
6. Balance – Average yearly account balance (in euros)
7. Housing – Has housing loan
8. Loan – Has personal loan
9. Contact – Contact communication type
10. Day – Last contact day of the month
11. Month – Last contact month
12. Duration – Duration of last contact (in seconds)
13. Campaign – Number of contacts performed during this campaign
14. P.days – Number of days since client was last contacted
15. Previous – Number of contacts performed before this campaign
16. Outcome – Outcome of the previous marketing campaign

# Models Used

Models Used and Evaluation Metrics

In this project, six different machine learning classification algorithms were implemented and compared to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

-> Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression:
A linear model used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability of a class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.

2. Decision Tree Classifier:
A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values to make classification decisions.

3. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):
A distance-based algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its nearest neighbors.

4. Naive Bayes (GaussianNB):
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of feature independence.

5. Random Forest Classifier:
An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs for better accuracy and reduced overfitting.

6. XGBoost Classifier:
An advanced gradient boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially to improve performance and handle complex patterns.

| KNN                 | 0.829    | 0.884 | 0.829     | 0.807  | 0.818 | 0.658 |
| Naive Bayes         | 0.717    | 0.810 | 0.804     | 0.534  | 0.642 | 0.448 |
| Random Forest       | 0.861    | 0.919 | 0.831     | 0.887  | 0.858 | 0.724 |

# Steps to Execute code in VS Code
1. Clone the repository using git clone command and url: https://github.com/hetagnyajani/ML-ASSIGNEMNT-2-2024dc04169_Jani-Hetagnya-.git
2. Then run pip install -r requirements.txt and load required dependencies
3. Now write streamlit run app.py in the terminal to execute it
4. It will Execute the code and it will open the streamlit app in the browser.
5. If does not open then manually go to http://localhost:8501

# How to Use the Application

1. Upload the test dataset (.csv file)
2. Select the desired Machine Learning model
3. View prediction results
4. Analyze evaluation metrics and probability distribution, Confusion Matrix.

# Conclusion
In this assignment, multiple Machine Learning models were implemented and evaluated for the Bank Marketing Classification problem. The performance comparison shows that ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost achieved the highest accuracy, AUC, F1-score, and MCC values, indicating better generalization and predictive performance.

Among all models, XGBoost performed the best overall, followed closely by Random Forest. Simpler models like Logistic Regression and KNN also produced competitive results, while Naive Bayes showed comparatively lower recall and MCC.

This comparative analysis demonstrates that ensemble techniques provide more robust and reliable predictions for this dataset.
